# Metastable Cortical Network with Spike-Frequency Adaptation

This repository contains simulation and analysis code for a metastable spiking attractor network model that incorporates **spike-frequency adaptation (SFA)**.  
The project explores how adaptation shapes metastable dynamics, transition statistics, and temporal structure in cortical-like recurrent networks.
